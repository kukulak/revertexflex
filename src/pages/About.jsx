              I try to capture the moment, that fraction of time, it can be big or little.
              Yocta moment or Yotto moment, could be very clouse like when the light bounce, that tiny moment, or when the light bonced many times in a bigger period of time, when a moment transfrom it self in to an object.

            Its not warranted that your sculpture will be 100% unique but the probability to have two equal scultures is realy low.
