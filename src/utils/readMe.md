# About

I whant to create scuptures with data of the customer.

#### First
    Ask user for info:

        1. Name
        2. Sure Name
        3. Nick Name
        4. BirthDate
        5. Favorite Number
        6. colors

#### Second
   
   Process the Data to have an array using:

    charCode.js
        Takes the data strings
        and return an array of numbers

    sucesionFibonacci.js
        Takes the first two numbers and the length
        of the charCode array and return a new array

    sumatoria.js
        Takes number elements of any array and transforms them
        to be only one digit numbers

> data --> charCodeArray --> sumatoria-Char

> charcodeArray --> sucesionFibonacci --> sumatoria-Fibonacci   

The two arrays combined together to create the Final Array

#### Third

The Final Array is the data that will be used with three.js fiber to make the sculptures in a nice front End design or not.

#### Fourth

Create a backend that saves the user array that creates the sculpture, each user could have many sculptures.

#### Fiveth

The Sculptures could be buyed as real 3d printed sculpture or as an NFT

### Last:

The Final Sculpture made with rays
